# Project Overview

## Overview

This is a minimal static HTML project containing a simple "Hello World" webpage. The project consists of a single HTML file that displays a basic greeting message in the browser. This appears to be either a starter template or a foundational project that could be expanded into a larger web application.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Static HTML**: Single-page application using vanilla HTML
- **No Framework**: Pure HTML without any JavaScript frameworks or libraries
- **Minimal Structure**: Basic HTML5 document structure with semantic elements
- **No Styling**: Currently uses browser default styling without custom CSS

### Rendering Approach
- **Client-side Rendering**: Content is rendered directly in the browser
- **Static Content**: No dynamic content generation or server-side processing
- **Single Entry Point**: All content served from a single `index.html` file

### File Organization
- **Flat Structure**: All files (currently just one) are in the root directory
- **Standard Naming**: Uses conventional `index.html` as the main entry point

## External Dependencies

### Runtime Dependencies
- **Web Browser**: Requires a modern web browser to display content
- **HTTP Server**: Needs a web server to serve the HTML file (development or production)

### Development Dependencies
- **None**: No build tools, package managers, or development frameworks currently in use
- **No Third-party Libraries**: No external JavaScript libraries or CSS frameworks
- **No APIs**: No external API integrations or data sources
